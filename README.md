# Stocks_HistoricalData_Using_Python
This project is a Python-based application designed to retrieve and manage historical stock data using the nsepython library. The application leverages pandas for efficient data manipulation and management, ensuring users can seamlessly analyze historical stock trends and patterns. To enhance user interaction, a graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented using tkinter, providing a user-friendly platform to access and visualize stock data.

Key Features:
    Data Retrieval: Access historical stock data from the NSE (National Stock Exchange) using the nsepython library.
    Data Management: Utilize pandas for efficient data handling, including filtering, sorting, and analysis.
    User Interface: An intuitive GUI built with tkinter to facilitate easy data access and visualization.

Libraries Used:
    nsepython: For fetching historical stock data.
    pandas: For data management and manipulation.
    tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
